But she returns, changed, and with a few surprises for her family and neighbours.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nothing is ever the same again for the Gladneys, who learn that fate cares little for duty, that life rarely conforms to expectation, that God can’t be relied upon to heed any prayer.</p> <p>A story of exile and return, of loss and discovery, of retreat from grief and the saving power of love.</p>";
