window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b></p> <p>1946. Three years after a cataclysmic event that tore their lives apart, a mother and daughter flee Poland for Paris, shame and fear at their heels, not knowing how hard it is to escape your past.</p> <p>Nearly 80 years later, Gretel Fernsby lives a life that is a far cry from her traumatic childhood. When a couple moves into the flat below her in her London mansion block, it should be nothing more than a momentary inconvenience. However, the appearance of their nine-year-old son, Henry, brings back memories she would rather forget.</p> <p>Faced with a choice between her own safety and his, Gretel is taken back to a similar crossroads she encountered long ago. Back then, her complicity dishonoured her life, but to interfere now could risk revealing the secrets she has spent a lifetime protecting.</p> <p><i>All the Broken Places</i> is John Boyne's masterful sequel to his classic best seller <i>The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</i>, taking a character from that novel on a journey to a place she never goes—the past. Through her story, he explores the aftermath of the war and the effects of a lifetime of guilt.</p>";
