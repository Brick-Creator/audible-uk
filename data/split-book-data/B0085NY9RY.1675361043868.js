window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first girl had a bite mark on her neck, but they traced the DNA to her boyfriend. But the tabloids got hold of the story and called the killer <i>The Rottweiler</i> and the name stuck. The latest murder takes place very near Inez Ferry's antique shop in Marylebone. When the Rottweilerâ€™s trinkets start showing up in the shop, suddenly, everyone Inez knows is a suspect, and the killer feels all too close. Someone saw a shadowy figure running away past the station, but the only other clues are that the murderer usually strangles his victims and removes something personal - like a cigarette lighter or a necklace. Since her husband died, Inez has supplemented her income by taking in tenants. The murderous activities of the sinister 'Rottweiler' will exert a profound influence on the lives of this heterogeneous little community, especially when the suspicion emerges that one of them may be a homicidal maniac.</p>";
