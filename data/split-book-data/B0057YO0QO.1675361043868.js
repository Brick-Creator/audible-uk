window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In a time when much of the country sees red whenever the subject of gay marriage comes up, Dan Savage - outspoken author of the column </b><b><i>Savage Love - </i></b><b>makes it personal.</b></p> <p>Dan Savage’s mother wants him to get married. His boyfriend, Terry, says “no thanks” because he doesn’t want to act like a straight person. Their 6-year-old son, D.J., says his two dads aren’t “allowed” to get married but that he’d like to come to the reception and eat cake.&nbsp;</p> <p>Throw into the mix Dan’s straight siblings, whose varied choices form a microcosm of how Americans are approaching marriage these days, and you get a rollicking family memoir that will have everyone - gay or straight, right or left, single or married - howling with laughter and rethinking their notions of marriage and all it entails.</p>";
