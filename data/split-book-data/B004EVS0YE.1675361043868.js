Life for Ambrose Ribbon is lonely, paranoid and obsessive without his mother, yet there is one book that he associates particularly with her: Volume VIII of the Encyclopedia Britannica, <i>Piranha to Scurfy'</i>. It marked a very significant moment in their relationship. But now that she is gone, Ambrose is left to spend his days reading and critiquing novels and writing vicious letters to their authors, pointing out these errors of fact and usage. No one can blame him, this is after all what his mother taught him. Then, one day he comes upon a book that attacks him.</p>";
