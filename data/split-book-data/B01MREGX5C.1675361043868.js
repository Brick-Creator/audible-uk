The personality traits of his Asperger's Syndrome help him maintain objectivity - a critical component of his business's continuing success. </p><p>But when Tyler Clayton, a young man who also has Asperger's, asks if a store clerk is truly his friend, Samuel, for the first time, can't bear to give an objective answer. It's a dicey situation that only gets worse when one of the key players ends up dead. Resolving to do the right thing, Samuel, with help from his associate Ms. Washburn, wades into the murky waters of friendship, and the answer he finds may be a revelation to himself most of all. </p>";
