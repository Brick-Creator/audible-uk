window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Based on historic events and frighteningly relevant to today’s headlines - a taut thriller about one American diplomat’s year of living dangerously in Tehran in the days leading up to the Iranian Revolution....</b></p> <p>In the style of Alan Furst, this suspenseful thriller - based on real events - places an idealistic American diplomat in a turbulent, US-hating Tehran in the days leading up to the Iranian Revolution. Backed by the CIA, and trailed by a beautiful and engaging French journalist he suspects is a spy, David Weiseman’s mission is to ease the Shah of Iran out of power and find the best alternative between the military, religious extremists, and the political ruling class - many of whom are simultaneously trying to kill him.</p>";
