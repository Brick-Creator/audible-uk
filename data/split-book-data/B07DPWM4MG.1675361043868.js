window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Can Jane Tennison uncover a serial killer?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The fourth in the <i>Sunday Times </i>best-selling Jane Tennison thrillers, <i>Murder Mile</i> is set in 1979 at the height of the 'Winter of Discontent', when economic chaos has led to widespread strikes across Britain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Jane Tennison, now a Detective Sergeant, has been posted to Peckham CID, one of London's toughest areas. As the rubbish on the streets begins to pile up, so does the murder count: two bodies in as many days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>There are no suspects, and the manner of death is different in each case. The only link between the two victims is the location of the bodies, found within a short distance of each other near Rye Lane in Peckham. Three days later another murder occurs in the same area. Press headlines scream that a serial killer is loose on 'Murder Mile' and that police incompetence is hampering the investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Jane is under immense pressure to catch the killer before they strike again. Working long hours with little sleep, what she uncovers leaves her doubting her own mind.</p>";
