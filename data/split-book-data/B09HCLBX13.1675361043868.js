window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Twelve-year-old Sophie and her mother, Amelia-Rose, move to London from Massachusetts where they meet the charismatic Matty Melgren, who quickly becomes an intrinsic part of their lives. But as the relationship between the two adults fractures, a serial killer begins targeting young women with a striking resemblance to Amelia-Rose.</p> <p>When Matty is eventually sent down for multiple murders, questions remain as to his guilt—questions that ultimately destroy both women.

But will the truth set her free—or bury her deeper?</p>";
