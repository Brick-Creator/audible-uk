window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Samuel Hoenig answers questions for a living. And as a man with Asperger's syndrome, his unique personality helps him ferret out almost any answer there is. But his latest question is a rather odd one: who stole a preserved head from the Garden State Cryonics Institute? </p> <p>Arriving at the scene of the crime accompanied by his new colleague, Ms. Washburn, Samuel finds that what started out as a theft has escalated to murder. With suspects and motives emerging at a rapid rate, one final question remains: can Samuel's powers of deduction uncover a killer in the face of overwhelming odds?</p>";
