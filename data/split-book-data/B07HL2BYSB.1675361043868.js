Her husband, Paul, is gone, and a thrashing hangover has wiped her memory clean. At first, she's relieved for the break from her tumultuous marriage; perhaps Paul just needed some space.

And what will she do to get it?</p> <p>A chilling look at marriage, madness, and the lives we think we lead, <i>When You Find Me</i> is a daring debut from a talented new voice in psychological suspense.</p>";
