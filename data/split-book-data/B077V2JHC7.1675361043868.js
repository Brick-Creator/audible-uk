window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This is the seventh book in the Tyack &amp; Frayne Mystery series.</b> </p><p>Lee would gladly trade all his psychic gifts for a chance at ordinary life with his husband and his little girl. Three years into their marriage, they're settled in their new home - but the House of Joy can't shield them from an oncoming threat with the power to uproot their whole world. </p><p>Lee can't define it further, and even his beloved Gideon can't unmask a monster with no face at all. Gideon is mired in problems and secrets of his own as he struggles to adjust to his new rank and the complexities of plainclothes police work with CID, and for once the devoted Tyack-Frayne partnership is failing to communicate. </p><p>Turbulent times in the world at large reach deep into the Bodmin heartland, and the village of Dark is without its guardian constable. More than Lee and Gideon can possibly know has been depending upon their rapport, and as the summer rises towards the longest day, a new and unfathomable kind of Beast is afoot on the moors.... </p>";
