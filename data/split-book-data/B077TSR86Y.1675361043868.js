window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Now Lee is free from the malevolent ghost of Morris Hawke, his clairvoyant gifts are expanding fast. Too fast for comfort, and he and Gideon find themselves wrestling with his unsettling capacity to see the future. In some ways this new power is wonderful, and Lee finds himself a local hero after predicting a flood. </p><p>But there's one aspect he can't bear, and that's the blind spot he sees when he thinks about the wedding plans he and Gideon have started to make. It's as if this event, which he wants more than life, simply isn't going to happen. He's troubled and stressed out, and Gideon decides to intervene, whisking him off to an isolated creekside cabin in the mysterious Cornish ria country. All is peaceful there, and the clamour in Lee's head subsides. It's time for companionship, peace, good food, and plenty of sex.... </p><p>Then a young man wanders out of the woods and turns their blissed-out retreat into chaos. Kitto is harmless - a charming drifter, very handsome. To Gideon he's just a kid, flesh and blood and a bit of a nuisance. But Lee reacts with horror. Since when can Gideon - Lee's rock, his connection to the real world and sanity - see ghosts? </p><p>Mysterious midsummer is rising in the deep green Cornish countryside, and as the village gears up for the eerie Golowan festival, Lee and Gideon face their toughest case yet: a battle between the real and spirit worlds that threatens to tear their own apart. </p>";
