They're the best of friends and godmothers to each other's daughters - because they trust that the safety of their children is both of their top priority.</p> <p>But what if their choice could harm your own child?</p> <p>Little do they know that they differ radically over one very important issue. And when Bryony, afraid of being judged, tells what is supposed to be a harmless white lie before a child's birthday party, the consequences are more catastrophic than either of them could ever have imagined....</p>";
