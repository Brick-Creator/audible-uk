window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From a talented new name in crime fiction comes a gritty tale of how far we'll go to protect the ones we love.</p> <p>Everyone says the Elders family are nothing but cheats, thieves, and convicts - a fact 19-year-old Jamie Elders has been trying desperately to escape. She may have the natural talent of a poker savant, but her dreams of going pro and getting the hell out of the tiny town of Blind River, New York, are going nowhere fast - especially when she lands in a huge pile of debt to her uncle Loyal.&nbsp;</p> <p>At Loyal's beck and call until her debt is repaid, Jamie can't easily walk away - not with her younger brother Toby left at his mercy. So when Loyal demands Jamie's help cleaning up a mess late one night, she has no choice but to agree. But disposing of a dead man and covering up his connection to the town's most powerful judge goes beyond family duty. When it comes out that the victim was a beloved athlete and Loyal pins the murder on Toby, only Jamie can save him. But with a dogged detective on her trail and her own future at stake, she'll have to decide: Embrace her inner criminal, or defy it - and face the consequences.</p>";
