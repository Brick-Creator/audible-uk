window.bookSummaryJSON = "In this concluding book of Adrian McKinty's highly praised Dead series, Michael Forsythe confronts his former lover and archrival, Bridget, a New York Irish Mob boss. <p>Michael has survived his infiltration of an IRA splinter cell in Boston, and now, his many near fatal wounds healed, he begins his next adventure as manager of hotel security in Lima, Peru. It is there that he is contacted by Bridget, whose fiancé he killed.</p> <p>Bridget, calling from Dublin, says that her 11-year-old daughter has been kidnapped. Michael's choice is to fly to Dublin and help her find the girl, or be executed at the hands of Bridget's goons, who are holding him at gunpoint. He agrees to nothing, but is soon on the way to Dublin, leaving the first two of many dead bodies in his wake.</p>";
