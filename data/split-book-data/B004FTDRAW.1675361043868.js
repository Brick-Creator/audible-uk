window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>All his life, for almost as far back as he could remember, Victor had had a phobia. In prison, inevitably, he reflected on the grotesque way it had begun, about the panics and violent anger. He asked himself, too, why the child of happily married, middle-class parents should have needed to make motiveless and unreasoning attacks on women. </p><p>Holed up in that house with the girl, he had not meant to pull the trigger. It was panic. Panic, which came over him like a second skin, prickling him all over, crawling on him.... An attempted murder not only brings Victor Jenner face to face with himself, but also involves him in a strange and doomed triangular relationship.</p>";
