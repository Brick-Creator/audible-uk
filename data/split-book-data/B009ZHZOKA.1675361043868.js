window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Shortlisted for: Crime &amp; Thriller of the Year – Specsavers National Book Awards 2012</b></p> <p>A Glasgow post office. Martin Pavel cowers on the floor, his eyes locked on those of a terrified child. Above them a masked gunman wields an AK-47 while the boy’s grandfather calmly volunteers to help gather the money. Then the old man stands passively, hands by his sides, while the gunman raises the barrel and shoots him to shreds. Recently returned to work after the birth of her twins, DS Alex Morrow is called in to head the investigation. Morrow’s enquiries lead her to the door of Kenny Gallagher, a politician fighting for his political life – and his marriage – after he’s publicly accused of having an affair with a young employee.</p>";
