A burnt-out cottage, a fortune buried in the ashes - and a body that could solve a decades-old crime....</p> <p>Jack Warr is a young DC with the Metropolitan Police. Charming but aimless, Jack can't seem to find his place in the world - until he's drawn into an investigation that turns his life upside down.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the aftermath of a fire at a derelict cottage, a badly charred body is discovered, along with the burnt remnants of millions of stolen, untraceable bank notes - the hidden legacy of Dolly Rawlins and her gang of Widows.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jack's assignment to the case coincides with an investigation into his own past.
