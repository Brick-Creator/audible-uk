window.bookSummaryJSON = "In this exciting sequel to the acclaimed <i>Dead I Well May Be</i>, the mercenary Michael Forsythe is forced to infiltrate an Irish terrorist cell, confronting murder, mayhem, and the prospect of his own execution. <p>Michael is on holiday in Spain when a soccer riot between the Paddies and the Brits escalates out of control and he winds up in a Spanish prison. Enter Samantha, a beautiful British Intelligence agent. She makes Michael an offer he can't refuse: instead of extradition to Mexico to serve time for a prison break, he can infiltrate an IRA sleeper cell in the United States. Thrust into the nightmare world of men known for their distinctive brands of torture and revenge, Michael crosses and double-crosses key players, narrowly escapes his own lies, loses his only ally, and falls for the daughter of his enemy.</p>";
