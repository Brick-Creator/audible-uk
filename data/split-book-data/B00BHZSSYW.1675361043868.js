window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What sort of betrayal would drive a brother and sister apart? When Grace and her brother Andrew inherit their grandmother's house, they surprise few people by deciding to move in together. But they've always got on well and the London house is large enough to split down the middle. There's just one thing they've not taken into account though: what if one of them wants to bring a lover to the house? </p> <p>When Andrew's partner, James, moves in, and immediately picks a fight about the treatment of gay men, the balance is altered - with almost fatal consequences. </p> <p><i>The Child's Child</i> is both an intriguing examination of betrayal in families, and a taut, thrilling listen.</p>";
