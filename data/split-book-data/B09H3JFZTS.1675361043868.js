window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Brought to you by Penguin.</p> <p>The chilling and compulsive new novel from the number one best-selling author.</p> <p><i>We are each our own devil, and we make this world our hell.</i></p> <p>It's been 17 months since the Bloodsmith butchered his first victim, and Operation Maypole is still no nearer catching him. The media is whipping up a storm and the top brass are demanding results, but the investigation is sinking fast.</p> <p>Now isn't the time to get distracted with other cases, but Detective Sergeant Lucy McVeigh doesn't have much choice. When Benedict Strachan was just 11, he hunted down and killed a homeless man. No one's ever figured out why Benedict did it, but now, after 16 years, he's back on the streets again—battered, frightened, convinced a shadowy 'They' are out to get him, and begging Lucy for help.</p> <p>It sounds like paranoia, but what if he's right? What if he really <i>is</i> caught up in something bigger and darker than Lucy's ever dealt with before? What if the Bloodsmith isn't the only monster out there? And what's going to happen when Lucy goes after them?</p>";
